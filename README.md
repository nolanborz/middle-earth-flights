Hello, this is my flight-selector project for the Full Stack Ruby on Rails Track of the Odin Project.
-Full Stack Ruby on Rails https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails
-Flight Selector Project details: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker

This full stack project is indeed *full stack* and includes front end forms, design, layouts, all connected to a back end database which
ultimately works to help the user find the right one-way flight for them. 

I've taken some creative liberties to take the flight selector business to the good inhabitants of Middle Earth. Because they do deserve better.

Best,
Nolan
